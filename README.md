~ Learn to animate through playing games! ~

### Intro
The threshold to learning how to animate is high. But the threshold to starting can be even higher. There are many people who would like to learn how to animate. But procrastination can easily hold one back from their desired achievements. Which in turn will delay them from ever starting to learn.

My solution is to tackle this problem starting from a young age. I will focus my attention on children between the ages of 9 and 13. This category of children are young enough to have a big aptitude towards learning new subject matters and old enough to handle the animation techniques I am planning on teaching them.

My plan is to discretely teach young children how to animate through playing simple mini games on their own devices. Which in turn will slightly lessen the threshold of learning how to skilfully animate when they are older.

This game is made in Unity. The animations and some of the designs are made with "RoughAnimator" and "Artflow". The most challenging part of this project for me was learning how to use Unity. I had never used it before and once I dived in, I quickly figured out the possibilities with it are endless.
